Hi, Iâ€™m @Technicalcommunication
- Iâ€™m interested in technical communication, cloud computing and technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX/UI Design.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source tech projects as a technical writer and as a translator.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write fiction and jokes in my free time.
