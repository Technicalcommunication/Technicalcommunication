            <h2>Issue: Conference Camera Not Recognized by Video Conferencing Software in a Desktop Computer or Laptop</h2>
            <h3>Symptom:</h3>
            <p>Your camera appears to be functioning correctly otherwise, but it's not detected or recognized by your video conferencing software (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet).</p>
            <h3>Possible Causes:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Camera Settings:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Camera is disabled: Check the camera settings within your video conferencing software to make sure the camera is enabled and selected as the default video input device.</li>
                        <li>Privacy settings: Ensure your operating system's privacy settings allow the video conferencing software to access the camera.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Software Conflicts:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Other applications using the camera: Close any other applications that might be using the camera, such as different video conferencing software, webcam utilities, or even photo editing software.</li>
                        <li>Background processes: Check the task manager in your computer or activity monitor for any background processes that could be interfering with the camera.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Driver Issues:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outdated drivers: Ensure you have the latest drivers installed for your conference camera. Visit the manufacturer's website to download and install the most recent drivers for your specific camera model and operating system and do the same with port or bluetooth drivers if applicable.</li>
                        <li>Corrupted drivers: If updating the drivers doesn't solve the problem, uninstall the existing drivers and then reinstall them again.</li>
                        <li>Conflicting drivers: If you have multiple cameras or other devices connected, there could be driver conflicts. Try disconnecting other devices and see if the conference camera is recognized.</li>

                        <li>Connection problems: Ensure the camera is properly connected to your computer. If you’re using a USB connection, try a different USB port or cable.</li>
                        <li>Faulty camera: In rare cases, the camera itself might be malfunctioning. If you have access to another computer, try connecting the camera to it to see if it works.</li>
